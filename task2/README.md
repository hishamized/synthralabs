Interactive To-Do List

This is a simple and responsive interactive to-do list web application built for Task 2 of the Synthra Labs Internship. The application allows users to manage their daily tasks through an intuitive interface and supports task persistence using browser local storage.

The application allows users to add new tasks using a form. Tasks can be edited or deleted individually. Each task can be marked as completed, with a visual indicator such as a strikethrough or checkbox to reflect its status. The interface is designed to be clean and minimal for a distraction-free user experience.

Completed tasks are retained even after refreshing the page using browser local storage. All functionality is implemented using vanilla JavaScript without the use of external libraries or frameworks.

This project demonstrates the use of basic front-end development concepts including DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage.

Technologies used include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project was developed by Mohammad Hisham Mir as part of the Synthra Labs Internship Task 2.
