Personal Portfolio Website

This is a fully responsive personal portfolio website developed for Task 1 of the Synthra Labs Internship. The website serves as a digital resume and project showcase, allowing visitors to learn about my background, skills, and work.

The website includes an about section with a brief introduction, career goals, and a professional photo. It features a skills section highlighting both technical and soft skills using visual elements such as icons and progress bars. A projects section is included to showcase at least three projects with their titles, descriptions, technologies used, and links where available. The contact section provides a form for user inquiries and includes clickable links to social media profiles and email.

The design is clean and mobile-friendly, ensuring usability across various screen sizes. The layout and styling aim to reflect both professionalism and personality.

Technologies used include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A CSS framework like Bootstrap may be used to enhance responsiveness and layout.

This project was developed by Mohammad Hisham Mir as part of the Synthra Labs Internship Task 1.
